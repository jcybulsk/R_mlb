Analysis of baseball statistics using R

Here I include some scripts I have written to perform an analysis of baseball statistics using 
some tools I've picked up over the years in my astronomy studies. 

All the MLB data used herein comes from Sean Lahman's public database, found here:

mlb_hitter_clustering.R - This script performs a mySQL query of a MLB database, stored at the 
                          time on my local computer, and carries out a hierarchical clustering 
                          analysis of some key hitting stats from 1996-2015.

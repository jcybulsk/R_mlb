Analysis of baseball statistics using R

Here I include some scripts I have written to perform an analysis of baseball statistics using 
some tools I've picked up over the years in my astronomy studies. 

mlb_hitter_clustering.R - This script performs a mySQL query of a MLB database, stored at the 
                          time on my local computer, and carries out a hierarchical clustering 
                          analysis of some key hitting stats from 1996-2015.
